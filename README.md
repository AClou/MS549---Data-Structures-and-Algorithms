# MS549---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Project Title: Ride Share Simulator

Purpose: Simulator of a ride share application to showcase the use of different data structures and algorithms. 
          Structures used are for making the simulation run efficiently, even as the data involved increases in scale.
          Algorithms used are for simplifying the development process and creating reusable code that will be less likely to break.

How to Run: Had issues here! Not sure about this part...

Dependencies: None

Map Data Format: Comma-Separated-Values (.csv). Each start point (node) has a corresponding end point and weight (in minutes). Ex. A,B,3
